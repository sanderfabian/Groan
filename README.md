# Groan
 A small C# app that simulates the Groan game.
Groan is a game where two players roll dice to see who gets past the score required first. Dice are added to one another and made to be a temporary score. When a player passes the dice to their opponent, the temporary score is added to their cumulative score. When the cumulative score reaches or passes the score required, the player wins. Players who roll a 1, have their temporary score reset and made to pass their turn. If a player rolls two 1s, their cumulative score is also reset and are made to pass their turn.
